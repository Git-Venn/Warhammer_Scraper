The Warhammer_Scraper crawls the warhammer.com website and scrapes information of all products, then outputs information such as 'name', 'type', 'setting', 'price', 'isInStock' into a .csv file.

This is a python project that utilizes
- Scrapy framework
- Pandas library
- Exchange rate API from https://www.exchangerate-api.com

To run the scraper all you have to do is run the "crawler.exe" file located in the [dist] directory, a .csv file will then appear in the output folder.
